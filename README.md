# MiniBankAccountSystem [![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=py&theme=light)](https://skillicons.dev)

A simple banking system developed in Python using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).  
This personal project was created as part of my learning journey, aiming to simulate real-world banking operations through code.

## What I Learned

This project was an important step in my growth as a developer.  
I designed it from scratch to practice and apply core programming concepts, with a focus on Object-Oriented Programming.

Key learnings include:

- Encapsulation
- Class responsibility and modularity
- Code reusability
- Logical structuring and input validation
- Data handling (CPF validation and account management)

---

## Implemented Features

- Register new clients
- Validate CPF (Brazilian ID format)
- Create multiple accounts per client
- Deposit funds into selected accounts
- Withdraw funds with balance verification
- Display balances for all client accounts
- List accounts using CPF-based search

---

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: Manages user interaction and system menu
- `bank.py`: Handles client registration and account creation
- `client.py`: Stores client data and associated accounts
- `account.py`: Processes deposits, withdrawals, and balance checks

---

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.12
- Git & GitHub
- Git Bash (CLI)

---

## Terminal Testing

All features were tested manually via terminal.  
Test cases included:

- Creating new clients
- Opening multiple accounts for a single client
- Depositing and withdrawing funds
- Listing accounts and viewing balances
- Full GitHub version control and commit flow

## Final Thoughts

This project is a reflection of my commitment to growth and learning in software development.  
It showcases not only my technical evolution, but also the dedication and care I put into building each part of the system.

Thank you for exploring this repository.  
Feel free to share any feedback or suggestions â€” I'm always open to learning more!
